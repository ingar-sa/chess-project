Need to handle if we need to create a new file or read from an existing one

equivalent to "with open" in python. You don't need to close the file
try (InputStream inputStream - new FileInputStream(file)) {
    doStuffWithFile(inputStream)

} catch (IOexception e) { -> doStuffWithFile must throw IOexception
    handle exception
}

writer.println(line)
-> (automatic newline) writer.println(line2)
